# MSA-Robotics-Final_Project

Congrats on reaching the end of the course! Given the shortened time frame you'll have two options for the final project:

# Prerequistes:
For all of these options, you'll have to create your own repo. So create one on Git Hub, clone into it, place the appropriate files from here on there, then once complete push changes to your remote repo.
You will submit a link to your repo in the Google Form below so we can review your project.
Watch this video on setting up the project for options 1 & 2: https://mit.zoom.us/rec/share/vNzognLTyRUpDtGuNW9eTX_Zu3oBqEuTz4P16A8DTfbkkixn1hHlDnCoKtjD2Ord.OC6zpAv9MGV967Tn?startTime=1693516259000

# Option 1:
This is for those who were successfully able to complete the installation guide. 
1. Clone this repo to retrieve the turtlesim code. Your job is to fill in the missing lines of turtlesim_keyboard_control.py and get it to work on the turtlesim environment.
2. Watch the setup video here on how to create the keyboard controller workspace and paste the working code.
3. Once your code works, you should be able to move the turtle and draw.
4. Create a text file in your local repo. On your turtlesim terminal, print out the topics and nodes running and paste them to the text file (hint: these are two seperate commands).
Create any fun drawing you'd like, take a screenshot, and then place it in your repo.

# Option 2 (Challenge):
This is similar to option 1 except it involves controls! Fill in the TODOs in turtlesim_keyboard_control_challenge.py, tune the Kd, Ki, and Kp values to control the turtle around the screen without hitting the wall. Screenshot when done and place in your repo.

# Option 3:
If you were unable to complete the installation, then you can submit homework 2. Be sure you have a node diagram and a completed code file as well.


# Submission
Please submit everything through by Friday, September 1st, 11:59 PM EST here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf00d4B_pME6ckvbeM3_KJqBChC3yVO3QA9Y5v7fuSLr2XAcA/viewform?usp=sf_link
