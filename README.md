# MSA-Robotics-Final_Project

Congrats on reaching the end of the course! Given the shortened time frame you'll have two options for the final project:

Prerequistes:
For both of these options, you'll have to create your own repo. So create one on github, clone into it, place the appropriate files from here on there, then once complete push changes to your repo.
You will submit a link to your repo in the Google Form below so we can review your project.

##Option 1:
This is for those who were successfully able to complete the installation guide. Clone this repo to retrieve the turtlesim code. Your job is to fill in the missing lines and get it to work. 
Once it works, you should have a moving turtle that can draw. Create any fun drawing you'd like, take a screenshot, then upload to the Google Form below.

##Option 2:
If you were unable to complete the installation, then you can submit homework 2. Be sure you have a node diagram and a completed code file as well.


Please submit everything through by Friday, September 1st 11:59 PM EST here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf00d4B_pME6ckvbeM3_KJqBChC3yVO3QA9Y5v7fuSLr2XAcA/viewform?usp=sf_link
